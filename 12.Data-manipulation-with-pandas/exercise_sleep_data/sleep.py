# Your client, SleepInc, has shared anonymized sleep data from their hot new sleep tracking app SleepScope. 
# As their data science consultant, your mission is to analyze the lifestyle survey data with Python
# to discover relationships between exercise, gender, occupation, and sleep quality. 
# See if you can identify patterns leading to insights on sleep quality.
# ðŸ’¾ The data: sleep_health_data.csv
# SleepInc has provided you with an anonymized dataset of sleep and lifestyle metrics for 374 individuals. 
# This dataset contains average values for each person calculated over the past six months. 
# The data is saved as sleep_health_data.csv.
