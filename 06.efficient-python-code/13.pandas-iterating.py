# .iloc is useful for row/column access by position, but not optimal for performance.
# Vectorized NumPy operations are fastest — they operate on full arrays at once and avoid Python loops.

# Performance ranking (fastest → slowest):
# 1.	✅ NumPy vectorization
# 2.	🟡 .itertuples()
# 3.	🔴 .apply() with axis=1 (convenient, but slow)

# Prefer vectorization when:
# • Working with numeric columns
# • Applying mathematical functions
# • Writing performance-sensitive code
# Use .apply() only when:
# • You need row-wise custom logic that’s hard to vectorize

#  use itertuples rarely, only when:
# •	You must loop row by row (e.g. row-dependent I/O, conditionals, or side effects).
# •	Performance matters more than flexibility (it’s faster than .iterrows()).
# •	Vectorization isn’t possible.
