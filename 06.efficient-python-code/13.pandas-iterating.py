# .iloc is useful for row/column access by position, but not optimal for performance.
# Vectorized NumPy operations are fastest â€” they operate on full arrays at once and avoid Python loops.

# Performance ranking (fastest â†’ slowest):
# 1.	âœ… NumPy vectorization
# 2.	ðŸŸ¡ .itertuples()
# 3.	ðŸ”´ .apply() with axis=1 (convenient, but slow)

# Prefer vectorization when:
# â€¢ Working with numeric columns
# â€¢ Applying mathematical functions
# â€¢ Writing performance-sensitive code
# Use .apply() only when:
# â€¢ You need row-wise custom logic thatâ€™s hard to vectorize

#  use itertuples rarely, only when:
# â€¢	You must loop row by row (e.g. row-dependent I/O, conditionals, or side effects).
# â€¢	Performance matters more than flexibility (itâ€™s faster than .iterrows()).
# â€¢	Vectorization isnâ€™t possible.
