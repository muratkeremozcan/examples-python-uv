Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank.
She had nothing to do, and the day was dull and quiet.
Suddenly, a curious cat appeared on the scene.
The cat was a mysterious creature, unlike any other.
At one point, the cat meowed softly as if saying, "I am the cat of many names."
In the distance, another CAT could be heard, adding to the strange chorus.
